# Workflow

I plan on creating a SPA for logging where the time is being invested while developing a solution. My objective is to be able to present a summary to my clients as well as help me organize myself through a custom-made application. 

As a plus it would be interesting to be able to link my commits to the repositories to the activities to easily make a connection between the activity and the actual code that was modified, whenever it applies.

This implies the requirement to generate various catalogs like the following:
* Projects to be able to link a certain activity to a project. Planning to begin with basic information as a MVP but with plans on improving the captured information, like for example including deadlines, budget, etc.
* Clients to link the project to a specific person / company.
